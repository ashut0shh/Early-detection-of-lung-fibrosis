## meeting 3 with sir 
-  Collect dataset links
- [x] clean up slides in the order sir wants("it should tell a story").
- [x] collect datasets
- [ ] preprocess data
- [ ] get started with a model once that is done



##Week 1 
- [x]Organize your 5 datasets:
    1 chest X-ray dataset
    4 lung sound datasets (filter for fibrosis + normal cases only)
- [x]Resize and normalize X-ray images
- [x]Convert lung sound files to spectrograms (Mel spectrograms or MFCCs)
- [x]Label data: fibrosis vs normal
- []Handle class imbalance (oversampling or data augmentation if needed)

  OpenCV, PIL, NumPy for X-ray preprocessing
  librosa, matplotlib, scikit-learn for lung sound processing

  ##Week 2
- []Train a CNN model for X-ray classification (fibrosis vs normal)
- []Train a sound-based model using MFCC/Spectrograms + CNN/LSTM
- []Tune hyperparameters
- []Validate using cross-validation or train/val/test split
- []Record accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

##Week 3
- []Write project report (intro, methodology, results, conclusion)
- []Make PowerPoint slides for presentation
- []Create a simple UI demo (streamlit or Tkinter)
- []Sketch design for future app integration (Android/Flutter/Web)


##Week 4
- []Write project report (intro, methodology, results, conclusion)
- []Make PowerPoint slides for presentation
- []Create a simple UI demo (streamlit or Tkinter)
- []Sketch design for future app integration (Android/Flutter/Web)
