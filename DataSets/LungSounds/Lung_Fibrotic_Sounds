# 🎧 Lung Sound Dataset – Pulmonary Fibrosis Detection

This dataset contains lung sound recordings used to develop a machine learning model for the **early detection of pulmonary fibrosis**.

---

## 🏷 Categories

- **Normal** – Healthy lung sounds
- **Fibrosis** – Sounds with **Velcro-like crackles**, **dry crackles**, or medically marked as Pulmonary Fibrosis 

## 🎧 File Format

- **Audio Format**: `.wav`
- **Sample Rate**: Varied (standardized during preprocessing)
- **Duration**: Varies; segmented into 3–5 second clips

---

## 🔧 Preprocessing Steps

1. **Noise Removal** using filters (bandpass filtering)
2. **Segmentation** into fixed time windows (e.g., 3 seconds)
3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - **Mel Spectrograms**
   - **MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**
   - **Chroma Features**
   - **Zero-Crossing Rate**
4. **Normalization** for consistent input to ML models
5. **Categorization** into `Normal` and `Fibrosis` folders

---

## Spectrogram Visualization

Converted audio clips are transformed into **Mel Spectrogram images** for training CNN-based models. These are stored in the `spectrograms/` folder and named according to class labels.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Audio files not clearly labeled as **normal** or **fibrosis** were excluded.
- Further filtering may be done based on **signal-to-noise ratio** or **annotation quality**.
- Crackles labeled as "coarse" or "fine" were retained only if medically relevant to fibrosis.
